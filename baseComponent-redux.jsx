// THIS IS AN EXAMPLE REACT COMPONENT THAT USES REDUX. IT IS A PLACEHOLDER AND SHOULD BE EDITED
// react imports go here
import React from 'react';

// headless UI imports can go here
// import { Dialog } from '@headlessui/react'; -- example of a headless UI import

// react-redux imports go here
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
// import { add, reset } from "./calculatorSlice"; -- this is a commented out example of how a component can import actions it requires from a slice. Only import them if they are shown in the above text as existing. If they are not shown as available, they do not exist.

// Default export of [CELL_ID]_Component
export default function [CELL_ID]_Component() {
  // use dispatch from redux to dispatch actions
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  // IMPORTANT: This component serves as a placeholder and does not interact with the context state or functionality.
